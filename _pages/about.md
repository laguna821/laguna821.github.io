My name is Changhyun Ahn. I'm a social scientist specialized in effects of interactive media such as VR or video games. I studied journalism in Hallym University as a B.A. and got my M.A. degree in communication at Cleveland State University. Then I got my Ph.D in communication at University at Buffalo. Besides works, I like explorering new coffee shops, walking outside, listening to electro swing jazz musics, playing Beat Saber on Oculus Quest, or drinking craft beers.
